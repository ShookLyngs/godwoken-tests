Account-Faucet is a CLI tool to help you claim faucet to your Godwoken layer 2 accounts.

You can pass a `CKB private key`, the CLI will automatically calculate the layer 2 deposit address, and then claim faucet to the address. Or you can pass your `ETH address`, the CLI will do the same thing for you.

When Claiming with `ETH Address`, you can also pass your `CKB Address`
